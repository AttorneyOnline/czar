"""
Test utilities package (renamed from `tests.testing`).

This package contains light-weight mock classes and helpers used by tests.
They are intentionally minimal and only implement the surface used by
the tests. Extend them as more scenarios are covered.

- Protocol-level mocks: MockClient, MockServer, MockClientManager
- Command-level mocks: CommandClient
